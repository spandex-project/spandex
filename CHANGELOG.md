# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

[NEXT]: https://github.com/spandex-project/spandex/compare/vNEXT...v2.2.0

### Added

- `Spandex.current_context/1` and `Spandex.Tracer.current_context/1` functions,
  which get a `Spandex.SpanContext` struct based on the current context.

- `Spandex.inject_context/3` and `Spandex.Tracer.inject_context/2` functions,
  which inject a distributed tracing context into a list of HTTP headers.

### Changed

- The `Spandex.Adapter` behaviour now requires an `inject_context/3` callback,
  which encodes a `Spandex.SpanContext` as HTTP headers for distributed
  tracing.

## [2.2.0]

[2.2.0]: https://github.com/spandex-project/spandex/compare/v2.2.0...v2.1.0

### Added
- The `Spandex.Trace` struct now includes `priority` and `baggage` fields, to
  support priority sampling of distributed traces and trace-level baggage,
  respectively. More details about these concepts can be found in the
  OpenTracing documentation.  An updated version of the `spandex_datadog`
  library will enable support for this feature in terms of the
  `Spandex.Adapter` and `Sender` APIs.

### Changed
- It is no longer required that you specify the `env` option. If not specified,
  it will default to `nil`. This is useful, for example, for allowing the
  Datadog trace collector configured default to be used.
- The `Spandex.Adapter.distributed_context/2` callback now expects a
  `SpanContext` struct to be returned, rather than a `Map`.
- Similarly, the `Spandex.continue_trace` function now expects a `SpanContext`
  struct rather than a separate `trace_id` and `span_id`.
- The sender API now calls the `send_trace` function, passing in a
  `Spandex.Trace` struct, rather than passing a list of `Spandex.Span` structs.
  This means that you need to update the `spandex_datadog` to a compatible
  version.

### Deprecated
- `Spandex.continue_trace/4` is deprecated in favor of
  `Spandex.continue_trace/3`
- Similarly, `Tracer.continue_trace/4` is deprecated in favor of
  `Tracer.continue_trace/3`
