## 2.0 Upgrade Guide

This is Datadog-specific since that's currently the only adapter.

* Include the adapter as a dependency (see below).
* Replace any occurrences of `Spandex.Adapters.Datadog` with
  `SpandexDatadog.Adapter` in your code.
* Replace any occurences of `Spandex.Adapters.ApiSender` with
  `SpandexDatadog.ApiSender` in your code.

## Adapters

* [Datadog](https://github.com/spandex-project/spandex_datadog)
* Thats it so far! If you want another adapter, it should be relatively easy to
  write! This library is in charge of handling the state management of spans,
  and the adapter is just in charge of generating certain values and ultimately
  sending the values to the service.

## Attention

This library could use some work! I've become unexpectedly busy lately, so I
haven't had the time I thought I would to work on it. Any contributions, to
things like sampling, strict mode, different storage strategies and the like
would be greatly appreciated.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:spandex, "~> 2.2.0"}]
end
```

## Setup and Configuration

Define your tracer:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Tracer do
  use Spandex.Tracer, otp_app: :mya_app
end
```

Configure it:

```elixir
config :my_app, MyApp.Tracer,
  service: :my_api,
  adapter: SpandexDatadog.Adapter,
  disabled?: false,
  env: "PROD"
```

Or at runtime, by calling `configure/1` (usually in your application's startup)

```elixir
MyApp.Tracer.configure(disabled?: System.get_env("TRACE") != "true")
```

For more information on Tracer configuration, view the docs for
`Spandex.Tracer`. There you will find the documentation for the `opts` schema.
The entire configuration can also be passed into each function in your tracer
to be overridden if desired. For example:

`MyApp.Tracer.start_span("span_name", service: :some_special_service)`

Your configuration and the configuration in your config files are merged
together, to avoid needing to specify this config at all times.

To bypass the Tracer pattern entirely, you can call directly into the functions
in `Spandex`, like `Spandex.start_span("span_name", [adapter: Foo, service:
:bar])`. Note that in this case, you will need to specify all of the
configuration options in each call, because the Tracer is not managing the
defaults for you.

### Adapter specific configuration

For adapter configuration, see the documentation for that adapter

## Phoenix Plugs

There are 3 plugs provided for usage w/ Phoenix:

* `Spandex.Plug.StartTrace` - See moduledocs for options. Goes as early in your
  pipeline as possible.
* `Spandex.Plug.AddContext` - See moduledocs for options. Either after the
  router, or inside a pipeline in the router.
* `Spandex.Plug.EndTrace` - Must go *after* your router.

## Distributed Tracing

Individual adapters can support distributed tracing. See their documentation
for more information.

## Logger metadata

In general, you'll probably want the current span_id and trace_id in your logs,
so that you can find them in your tracing service. Make sure to add `span_id`
and `trace_id` to logger_metadata

```elixir
config :logger, :console,
  metadata: [:request_id, :trace_id, :span_id]
```

## General Usage

The nicest interface for working with spans is the `span` macro, illustrated in
`span_me_also` below.

```elixir
defmodule ManuallyTraced do
  require Spandex

  # Does not handle exceptions for you.
  def trace_me() do
    Tracer.start_trace("my_trace") #also opens a span
    Tracer.update_span(service: :my_app, type: :db)

    result = span_me()

    Tracer.finish_trace()

    result
  end

  # Does not handle exceptions for you.
  def span_me() do
    Tracer.start_span("this_span")
    Tracer.update_span(service: :my_app, type: :web)

    result = span_me_also()

    Tracer.finish_span()
  end

  # Handles exception at the span level. Trace still must be reported.
  def span_me_also() do
    Tracer.span("span_me_also) do
      ...
    end
  end
end
```

### Metadata

See the module documentation for `Spandex.Span` as well as the documentation
for the structs contained as keys for that struct. They illustrate the keys
that are known to either be common keys or to have UI sugar with certain
clients. Its hard to find any kind of list of these published anywhere, so let
me know if you know of more!

For example:

```elixir
Spandex.update_span(
  type: :db,
  http: [url: "/posts", status_code: 400],
  sql_query: [query: "SELECT * FROM posts", rows: 10]
)
```

Spandex used to ship with function decorators, but those decorators had a habit
of causing weird compilation issues for certain users, and could be easily
implemented by any user of the library.

## Asynchronous Processes

The current `trace_id` and `span_id` can be retrieved and later used (for
example, from another process) as follows:

```elixir
trace_id = Tracer.current_trace_id()
span_id = Tracer.current_span_id()
span_context = %SpanContext{trace_id: trace_id, parent_id: span_id}
Tracer.continue_trace("new_trace", span_context)
```

New spans can then be logged from there and sent in a separate batch.

## Strategies

There is (currently and temporarily) only one storage strategy, which can be
changed via the `strategy` option. See Tracer opt documentation for an example
of setting it. To implement your own (ETS adapter should be on its way), simply
implement the `Spandex.Strategy` behaviour. Keep in mind that the strategy is
not an atomic pattern. It represents retrieving and wholesale replacing a
trace, meaning that it is *not* safe to use across processes or concurrently.
Each process should have its own store for its own generated spans. This should
be fine because you can send multiple batches of spans for the same trace
separately.
